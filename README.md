## PIG DICE ##
### PROJECT BY LUCAS LAMBERT ###


The concept was to have an online game of __PIG DICE__.

---
GAMES RULES:
    - Pig dice is a game that uses __random numbers__, where chance and a players decisions to reach a maximum score.
    - The __max score__ is set in the opening screen.

The front end of the website is pretty basic, with two different div boxes that appear at different times based on a user input.

We first have the log in screen which uses forms and click-listeners to store the values of the players (one & two) as well as the preferred max score..
The names of the players are stored and shown in the game table...

On click, the login pages disappears & a new page is displayed with the actual game.
